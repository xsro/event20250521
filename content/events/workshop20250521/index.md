{{< fixed-image src="images/Ahn2.png" width="300" height="300" alt="My Image" href="https://sites.google.com/view/hyosungahn">}}

Abstract:
This talk introduces matrix-weighted graphs as a generalization of scalar-weighted graphs. There are a number of motivations for utilizing the concept of matrix-weighted graphs such as modelling of social networks and trades in economic models, and describing of formation control of multi-agent systems, mechanical and electrical networks and electrical power flows. For coupled networks, matrix-weighted Laplacian can be used for analyzing the dynamic behaviors for both undirected graphs and directed graphs.

{{< fixed-image src="images/cao.png" width="300" height="300" alt="My Image" href="https://research.rug.nl/en/persons/ming-cao">}}

Abstract:
In this talk, we first define the k-level coverage problem using mobile sensor networks, in which each point in a given (convex) region of interest is simultaneously covered by k individual sensors. This formulation extends the standard setup of sensor network coverage problem by stipulating the stricter requirement of multiple responsible sensors for each region of the tessellation as a result of the partitioning of the region of interest. We use a modified Voronoi-like scheme to find out the (locally) optimal location and associated covering region for the mobile sensors and design a control law that drives individual mobile sensors to the optimal configuration asymptotically.

## Hyungbo Shim | Consensus of Vector Fields: Adaptation of Heterogeneous Node Dynamics

{{< fixed-image src="images/Shim2.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="My Image" href="https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en/research-faculty/faculty/fulltime?md=view&profid=p060">}}

Abstract:
We propose an adaptation mechanism for individual dynamical systems within a network. Initially, each system has distinct dynamics, but over time, adaptation occurs, leading to convergence toward a common vector field. The analysis is based on the blended dynamics theorem. The motivation and practical utility of this work will be explained. This work is currently under review for possible presentation at CDC 2025.

## 夏卫国 | 无人集群系统分布式编队安全控制

{{< fixed-image src="images/xia.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="My Image" href="https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/weiguo/zh_CN/index.htm">}}

Abstract:
The report proposes a robust formation control strategy for unmanned swarm systems, which aims to achieve a balance between formation performance and security in a dense obstacle environment. Based on the consensus algorithm and the adaptive security barrier function, we design a novel formation controller. Different from the traditional method, which uses the control obstacle function to construct the quadratic programming to ensure the safety of the unmanned system, the controller provides a closed-form solution with the guarantee of the existence of the solution, which avoids the problem that the quadratic programming is not feasible under multiple constraints. In addition, compared with the method of ensuring the safety of UAV by fixed safety distance, a dynamic safety distance mechanism based on adaptive adjustment of unmanned system speed is further proposed to improve system flexibility and environmental adaptability and meet the needs of obstacle avoidance in different scenarios. Simulation and physical experiments verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.
