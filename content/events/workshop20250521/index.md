## Hyo-Sung Ahn Matrix-Weighted Graphs: Motivations and Theory 

{{< fixed-image src="images/Ahn2.png" width="300" height="300" alt="My Image" >}}

Abstract:
This talk introduces matrix-weighted graphs as a generalization of scalar-weighted graphs. There are a number of motivations for utilizing the concept of matrix-weighted graphs such as modelling of social networks and trades in economic models, and describing of formation control of multi-agent systems, mechanical and electrical networks and electrical power flows. For coupled networks, matrix-weighted Laplacian can be used for analyzing the dynamic behaviors for both undirected graphs and directed graphs.

## 曹明 Optimal k-level coverage control using multi-centered Voronoi-like tessellations

{{< fixed-image src="images/cao.png" width="300" height="300" alt="My Image" >}}

Abstract:
In this talk, we first define the k-level coverage problem using mobile sensor networks, in which each point in a given (convex) region of interest is simultaneously covered by k individual sensors. This formulation extends the standard setup of sensor network coverage problem by stipulating the stricter requirement of multiple responsible sensors for each region of the tessellation as a result of the partitioning of the region of interest. We use a modified Voronoi-like scheme to find out the (locally) optimal location and associated covering region for the mobile sensors and design a control law that drives individual mobile sensors to the optimal configuration asymptotically.



## Hyungbo Shim Consensus of Vector Fields: Adaptation of Heterogeneous Node Dynamics

{{< fixed-image src="images/Shim2.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="My Image" >}}

Abstract:
We propose an adaptation mechanism for individual dynamical systems within a network. Initially, each system has distinct dynamics, but over time, adaptation occurs, leading to convergence toward a common vector field. The analysis is based on the blended dynamics theorem. The motivation and practical utility of this work will be explained. This work is currently under review for possible presentation at CDC 2025.

Bio:
Hyungbo Shim received his B.S. (1993), M.S. (1995), and Ph.D. (2000) degrees from Seoul National University. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and is currently a professor at Seoul National University. He has served as an associate editor for Automatica, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, and the International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control. He is a senior member of IEEE, an IFAC Distinguished Lecturer, and a member of the Korean Academy of Science and Technology. His research interests include stability analysis of nonlinear systems, observer design, disturbance observers, secure control systems, and synchronization in multi-agent systems.

{{< fixed-image src="images/xia.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="My Image" >}}

摘要: 
报告提出一种无人集群系统鲁棒编队控制策略，旨在实现密集障碍环境中编队性能与安全性的平衡。基于一致性算法与自适应安全障碍函数，我们设计了一种新颖编队控制器。与传统方法采用控制障碍函数构建二次规划来确保无人系统安全性不同，该控制器提供具有解存在性保证的闭式解，避免了多重约束下二次规划不可行的问题。此外，相较于通过固定安全距离保障无人机安全性的方法，进一步提出根据无人系统速度自适应调整的动态安全距离机制，提高系统灵活性和环境适应性，满足不同场景的避障需求。仿真与实物实验验证了所提算法的有效性和可行性。
